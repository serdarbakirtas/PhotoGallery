# Application Architecture
<p>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) was used. Representable protocols a bit different than other MVVM implementations. They exist only to hide view models details and share common methods between them by protocol-oriented programming concepts.
Thereâ€™s a special layer between the View and the Model called the ViewModel. ViewModel provides a set of interfaces, each of which represents a UI component in the View. 

We can use a few technique called for about the 'binding' to connect UI components to ViewModel interfaces. I used delegate for the observing. We can use a few options, Such as Signal, Delegate, KVO, Observer or Functional programing.

In MVVM, we do not use the View directly, we allocate ViewModel as logic and Therefore, We can write a unit test for the presentational logic without knowing the implementation of the View.</p>
